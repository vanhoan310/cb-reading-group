# cb-reading-group
Computational Biology reading group at the Gene Center of the LMU.

The CB reading group is held Thursday afternoons, 3pm, at BioSysM. The goal is to have a place where members can present their work in computational biolgy or discuss relevant papers.

Everyone is welcome to participate (faculty and students alike).  The only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time.

Please add papers that you would like to review to the wiki linked below.
