# cb-reading-group
Computational Biology reading group at the Gene Center of the LMU.

The CB reading group is held Wednesday mornings at BioSysM. The goal is to have a place where members can present their work in computational biolgy or discuss relevant papers.

Please add papers that you would like to review in the table.

### [Summer 2017 Reading Schedule](https://github.com/canzarlab/cb-reading-group/wiki/Summer-2017-Reading-Schedule)

Everyone is welcome to participate (faculty and students alike).  The only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time.
